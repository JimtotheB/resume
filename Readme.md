#Resume

### Install

To view a copy of my resume in its most pristine state simply...

```shell
# local install
$ npm install @paperelectron/resume

# global install
$ npm install -g @paperelectron/resume
```
### Run
By default the resume file will be served on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), you can pass in an
optional port with `jimtotheb --port [port]` if 8080 doesn't suit you.

```shell
# run local install
$ ./node_modules/.bin/jimtotheb --port 8000

# run global install
$ jimtotheb --port 8000
```

#### Related skills, hobbies and passions.

I am a lover of all things related to computing and programming, I obsessively practice my craft and take great joy in learning and using every new framework, language and platform that comes along. DevOps is my primary hobby so I have a home network that rivals many medium businesses, along with a fairly intricate vCenter cluster at home. I also enjoy embedded programming in C and C++ on the Arduino and standalone Atmel platforms. For fun I live vicariously through my son and attempt to dream up the next big thing, so far unsuccessfully.
